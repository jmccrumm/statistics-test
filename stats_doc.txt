This document is provided with instructions on how to compile and run stats.cpp
from the Terminal window. 
The purpose of this program is to read a file composed of X and Y values associated 
with a specific label. It essentially reads points on a graph from the file chosen
by the user, determines the distance each point is from the origin(0,0), and then 
calculates the mean, variance, skewness, and excess kurtosis of those distances.

Before the program is to be executed, the user must have a file to read from.
This can be a text-based file of any extension. In the provided example we use data.dat.
The contents of the file must be as follows:
    label, x-value, y-value
    label, x-value, y-value
    etc...
"label" in our example is either 1 or -1, which is used to mark which points are within
a certain radius on the graph.

To compile from Terminal:
1. Change to directory where stats.cpp is located. (needs to be a folder of which is 
    inside the 'dlib' directory)
2. Type the following into the terminal:
    g++ stats.cpp -o stats.out -I.. ../dlib/all/source.cpp -lpthread -lX11
3. Type "./stats.out" to run
4. When it prompts for the file to read from, type in the COMPLETE PATH to the .dat file
    (or whichever extension you used) and press ENTER
5. The program will first print out the calculated distances for each of the sample points,
    then will display the mean, variance, skewness, and excess kurtosis of all the 
    distances

For best results (and an easier way), run the main executable which includes all the
necessary functions all-in-one and follow the directions given in the Terminal window.
